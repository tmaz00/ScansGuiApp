<h1>GUI project for UDT data display</h1>

<p>Project of graphical user interface to display and visualize ultrasonic data</p>
It was developed as the engineer's thesis project.

<h2>Description</h2>
The program allows to load, preprocess and visualize data (binary files) from the chosen folder. Loaded data is stored in computer as 3D array and displayed with three 2D scans (which represent each plane of visualized array) and 1D scan (depth/amplitude plot).

<h2>Usage</h2>
To run and test the program on your computer:
<li> Copy /dist folder with all it's contents to your local machine without moving any of files inside
<li> Open main.exe file inside /dist folder
<li> In the shown window choose the /sample_data subfolder as the folder with data
<li> You can choose some extra options like filtering, normalizing to preprocess the data
<li> After clicking "Run" button main window should appear

Note: In order to run application correctly, all .ui files and .exe file have to be in the same directory. Otherwise, app would not run properly.
